Is your **body too acidic**? Maybe, but Most Likely Not. Maybe, but Most Likely Not. Maybe, but Most Likely Not. Maybe, but Most Likely Not. Many people have never even considered this question. The pH of our bodies is enormously important to our health, yet we hardly ever give it a second thought. Here’s why you should care…

The optimal condition for your body is a balanced environment that is not too acidic and not overly alkaline. If your body is overly acidic, you may be more susceptible to certain illnesses.

You may also become deficient in certain nutrients. This is because when the body is too acidic, the body may need to take minerals such as calcium, potassium and sodium from your bones to neutralize the acid. This can put your body under a lot of strain.

Because of the prevalence of the Western diet and an inactive lifestyle, many people today are somewhat acidic. If your acidity gets extreme, it is known as acidosis — a condition which requires urgent medical attention.

If it is mild, you may not notice a problem at first, until you find yourself feeling worse and worse in unexpected ways.

**Signs your body may be too acidic**

1. You feel fatigued, even when you’ve had enough sleep.
2. You feel depressed or have a hard time enjoying things that you used to.
3. You find yourself especially irritable for no discernable reason.
4. You feel like you cannot focus or have “brain fog” often.
5. You frequently develop infections, colds and flus.
6. Your skin is dry, even in the warmer months.
7. You have acne or other skin problems.
8. You have hormonal imbalance issues.
9. You frequently develop yeast infections.
10. You feel like your digestion is sluggish, or frequently experience constipation or diarrhea.
11. You find yourself becoming short of breath often.
12. You frequently experience joint pain.
13. You often experience headaches.
14. You experience chronic allergies or sinus pain.
15. You suffer from chronic pain that is not due to an injury or a medical condition.
16. Your neck often feels stiff or sore.
17. You have sensitive gums and teeth.

If you find you are experiencing multiple symptoms on this list, it’s time to check your pH. You can either have this done by a health professional or you can do it yourself at home.

If you’re going the DIY route, you can purchase pH test strips that use your saliva or urine. If you get a reading lower than 6.5, your body is too acidic.

If your pH reading is significantly lower than 6.5, you may have a more serious case of acidosis. If this is the case, make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as you can.

If the reading is 6.5 or slightly lower, you may be able to combat the problem at home (although it never hurts to visit a health professional you trust, just to be safe).
